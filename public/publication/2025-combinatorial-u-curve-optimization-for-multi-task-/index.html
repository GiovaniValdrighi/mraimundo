    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Multi-task learning (MTL) is an approach where a single model learns multiple tasks simultaneously, potentially reducing overfitting and speeding up the learning process. However, selecting the right combination of tasks is crucial to avoid negative transfer, where learning additional tasks might hinder rather than enhance performance. Research has explored task relationships through shared data samples, features, relational knowledge, and parameters. However, sharing relational knowledge, features, or parameters often requires domain knowledge, potentially introducing artificial connections between unrelated tasks. This paper presents an MTL algorithm based on combinatorial U-curve optimization, focusing on data sample sharing. It uses a branch-and-bound-based approach to identify beneficial source tasks without requiring prior domain knowledge. The method organizes tasks into a tree, optimizing selection with backtracking and pruning for efficient exploration and minimal negative transfer. Results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our algorithm is competitive with more sophisticated MTL frameworks such as Logistic L21, Dirty, and rMTFL, while maintaining a simpler design and fewer assumptions. In the Spam (Landmine) dataset, our algorithm yielded a mean loss that was 45% (62%) of the mean loss yielded by the second-best approach, Logistic Dirty (Logistic rMTFL). Although numerical improvements over these baselines are not always large, the proposed approach consistently matches or slightly outperforms them in most tasks, demonstrating robust performance even in scenarios with limited data or outliers.</p>
