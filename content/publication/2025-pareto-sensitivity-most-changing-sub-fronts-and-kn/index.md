abstract: When dealing with a multi-objective optimization problem, obtaining a comprehensive
  representation of the Pareto front can be computationally expensive. Furthermore,
  identifying the most representative Pareto solutions can be difficult and sometimes
  ambiguous. A popular selection are the so-called Pareto knee solutions, where a
  small improvement in any objective leads to a large deterioration in at least one
  other objective. In this paper, using Pareto sensitivity, we show how to compute
  Pareto knee solutions according to their verbal definition of least maximal change.
  We refer to the resulting approach as the sensitivity knee (snee) approach, and
  we apply it to unconstrained and constrained problems. Pareto sensitivity can also
  be used to compute the most-changing Pareto sub-fronts around a Pareto solution,
  where the points are distributed along directions of maximum change, which could
  be of interest in a decision-making process if one is willing to explore solutions
  around a current one. Our approach is still restricted to scalarized methods, in
  particular to the weighted-sum or epsilon-constrained methods, and require the computation
  or approximations of first- and second-order derivatives. We include numerical results
  from synthetic problems that illustrate the benefits of our approach.
