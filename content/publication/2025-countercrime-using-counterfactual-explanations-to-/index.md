abstract: 'Analyzing the impact of socioeconomic and urban variables on crime is a
  complex data analysis problem. Exploring synthetic, correlation-based scenarios
  using changes in a set of variables could alter a region’s definition from unsafe
  to safe (known counterfactual explanation), which can aid decision-makers in interpreting
  crime in that region and define public policies to mitigate criminal activity. We
  propose CounterCrime, a visual analytics tool for crime analysis that uses counterfactual
  explanations to add insights for this problem. This tool employs various interactive
  visual metaphors to explore the counterfactual explorations generated in each region.
  To facilitate exploration, we organize our analysis at three levels: the whole city,
  the region group, and the regional level. This work proposes a new perspective in
  crime analysis by creating “what-if” scenarios and allowing decision-makers to anticipate
  changes that would make a region safer. The tool guides the user in selecting variables
  with the most significant effect in all city regions. Using a greedy strategy, the
  system recommends the best variables that may influence crime in unsafe regions
  as the user explores. Our tool allows for identifying the most appropriate counterfactual
  explorations at the regional level by grouping them by similarity and determining
  their feasibility by comparing them with existing examples in other regions. Using
  crime data from São Paulo, Brazil, we validated our results with case studies. These
  case studies reveal interesting findings; for example, scenarios that influence
  crime in a particular unsafe region (or set of regions) might not influence crime
  in other unsafe regions.'
