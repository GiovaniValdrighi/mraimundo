abstract: The widespread use of machine learning in credit scoring has brought significant
  advancements in risk assessment and decision-making. However, it has also raised
  concerns about potential biases, discrimination, and lack of transparency in these
  automated systems. This tutorial paper performed a non-systematic literature review
  to guide best practices for developing responsible machine learning models in credit
  scoring, focusing on fairness, reject inference, and explainability. We discuss
  definitions, metrics, and techniques for mitigating biases and ensuring equitable
  outcomes across different groups. Additionally, we address the issue of limited
  data representativeness by exploring reject inference methods that incorporate information
  from rejected loan applications. Finally, we emphasize the importance of transparency
  and explainability in credit models, discussing techniques that provide insights
  into the decision-making process and enable individuals to understand and potentially
  improve their creditworthiness. By adopting these best practices, financial institutions
  can harness the power of machine learning while upholding ethical and responsible
  lending practices.
