abstract: Extracting and analyzing crime patterns in big cities is a challenging spatiotemporal
  problem. The hardness of the problem is linked to two main factors, the sparse nature
  of the crime activity and its spread in large spatial areas. Sparseness hampers
  most time series (crime time series) comparison methods from working properly, while
  the handling of large urban areas tends to render the computational costs of such
  methods impractical. Visualizing different patterns hidden in crime time series
  data is another issue in this context, mainly due to the number of patterns that
  can show up in the time series analysis. In this article, we present a new methodology
  to deal with the issues above, enabling the analysis of spatiotemporal crime patterns
  in a street-level of detail. Our approach is made up of two main components designed
  to handle the spatial sparsity and spreading of crimes in large areas of the city.
  The first component relies on a stochastic mechanism from which one can visually
  analyze probable×intensive crime hotspots. Such analysis reveals important patterns
  that can not be observed in the typical intensity-based hotspot visualization. The
  second component builds upon a deep learning mechanism to embed crime time series
  in Cartesian space. From the embedding, one can identify spatial locations where
  the crime time series have similar behavior. The two components have been integrated
  into a web-based analytical tool called CriPAV (Crime Pattern Analysis and Visualization),
  which enables global as well as a street-level view of crime patterns. Developed
  in close collaboration with domain experts, CriPAV has been validated through a
  set of case studies with real crime data in São Paulo - Brazil. The provided experiments
  and case studies reveal the effectiveness of CriPAV in identifying patterns such
  as locations where crimes are not intense but highly probable to occur as well as
  locations that are far apart from each other but bear similar crime patterns.
