abstract: Explainability is crucial for improving the transparency of black-box machine
  learning models. With the advancement of explanation methods such as LIME and SHAP,
  various XAI performance metrics have been developed to evaluate the quality of explanations.
  However, different explainers can provide contrasting explanations for the same
  prediction, introducing trade-offs across conflicting quality metrics. Although
  available aggregation approaches improve robustness, reducing explanations’ variability,
  very limited research employed a multi-criteria decision-making approach. To address
  this gap, this paper introduces a multi-criteria rank-based weighted aggregation
  method that balances multiple quality metrics simultaneously to produce an ensemble
  of explanation models. Furthermore, we propose rank-based versions of existing XAI
  metrics (complexity, faithfulness and stability) to better evaluate ranked feature
  importance explanations. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate
  the robustness of the proposed model across these metrics. Comparative analyses
  of various multi-criteria decision-making and rank aggregation algorithms showed
  that TOPSIS and WSUM are the best candidates for this use case.
