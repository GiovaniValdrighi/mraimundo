abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical
  concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have disadvantageous
  predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to mitigate discrimination
  against individuals based on protected attributes such as gender and race. In this
  work, we consider applying subgroup justice concepts to gradient-boosting machines
  designed for supervised learning problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting
  methodologies to explore a broader range of objective functions, which combines
  conventional losses such as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max
  fairness term. We study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max
  optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual problems
  at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to diverse fairness
  concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting algorithm was theoretically
  shown to converge under mild conditions and empirically shown to be a powerful and
  flexible approach to address binary and subgroup fairness.
