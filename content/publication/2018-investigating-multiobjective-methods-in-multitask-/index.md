abstract: 'Regularized multitask learning is explicitly interpreted hereas a many-objective
  optimization problem, dealt with a deterministic solver that properly controls the
  sampling of the Pareto frontier. Each objective function corresponds to the learning
  loss of a task, so that we have as many objectives as tasks. The obtained Pareto-optimal
  models are then explored to implement distinct learning sharing strategies: (1)
  by considering a single parameter vector for all tasks, the simplest learning model
  that could have been conceived in multitask learning, the distinct trade-offs along
  the Pareto frontier can be interpreted as efficient and diverse sharing perspectives
  for the multiple tasks; (2) those distinct sharing perspectives are then aggregated
  in an ensemble or the best model in the validation set is selected. Notice that
  using a single parameter vector for all tasks in our many-objective perspective
  should not be directly associated with that naive, and generally of low performance,
  procedure of taking all tasks as being equally related. Distinct trade-offs automatically
  promote the proposition of efficient and structurally diverse relationships among
  the learning tasks, which support a competitive performance when compared with consolidated
  multitask learning methods in classification problems.'
